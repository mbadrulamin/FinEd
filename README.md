## Description

FinEd (Financial Education) is an Android application developed as part of the Can You Hack It Asean Edition (CYHI 2021) Hackathon, organized by Hong Leong Bank | Hong Leong Islamic Bank. The app aims to address the issue of financial illiteracy among the younger generation and provide them with the knowledge and tools necessary to make informed financial decisions.

## Features

- Interactive Learning Modules: FinEd offers a series of interactive learning modules specifically designed for the young generation. These modules cover a wide range of financial topics, including budgeting, saving, investing, debt management, and financial planning. The content is presented in a user-friendly and engaging manner to ensure maximum understanding and retention.

- Gamification Elements: The app incorporates gamification elements to enhance the learning experience. Users can earn points, badges, and rewards as they progress through the learning modules and complete quizzes or challenges. This gamified approach helps to keep users motivated and encourages active participation.

- Personalized Recommendations: FinEd provides personalized recommendations based on the user's financial goals, income, and spending habits. These recommendations offer tailored insights and suggestions to improve financial health and achieve specific objectives, such as saving for a down payment, paying off debt, or starting an investment portfolio.

- Budgeting and Expense Tracking: The app includes a comprehensive budgeting and expense tracking feature. Users can set up budgets for different categories, track their expenses, and receive notifications or alerts when they exceed predefined limits. The visual representation of spending patterns helps users identify areas where they can cut back and save more effectively.

- Interactive Simulations: FinEd incorporates interactive simulations that allow users to experiment with different financial scenarios. For example, users can simulate the impact of investing in different asset classes, adjusting interest rates, or making additional loan payments. These simulations provide valuable insights into the potential outcomes of various financial decisions.
